# Using Gimp

Run the code to generate the image of the trajectory of the submarine, then open it with Gimp.
Look for the red pixel and multiply the two coordinates to get the answer.


This doesn't works quite well for the second part, as the depth is much much higher, actually the generated file is too large for Gimp to load it:

```
The “gimp-image-new-with-precision” procedure was called with the value “800466” for the “height” parameter (n°2, type GimpInt32). This value is out of range.
```

And the image file is very heavy: `8.1 Mo` (so I won't upload it here !).

Also, for part II, as the image is very huge, I manually set-up the image size so the code won't crash in trying to create a huge image.
