# Some assembly required

Not very usefull, but the code generated a Ti*k*Z code with the circuit displayed (in a very ugly way !).
Just look for the red node `a` in the exported [PDF](circuitI.pdf) ! (or look at the Python code, but is less funny)

Idem for part II in the other [PDF](circuitII.pdf).
